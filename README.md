## Run in a cloud without installation
This is as simple as following this [link](http://example.com/). This comes at the cost of lower computational resources being available to you. 

## Run locally
 
1.  Install Anaconda - [installation file](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (use `python 3.7`).
2.  Install JupyterLab - [instructions](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab#installation).
3.  Bootstrap virtual environment. 
    
    If you are on Unix, then execute in terminal:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IlyaKisil/dpm-coursework.git

    cd dpm-coursework

    ./boostrap-venv.sh
    ```
    
    If you are on Windows, then open Anaconda prompt:
    ```bash
    cd dpm-coursework
    ```
